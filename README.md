Gulp is used for building the css. You may want to install gulp globally `npm install -g gulp` if you plan on editing the codebase

```
npm install
npm start

// navigate to localhost:7890 in a browser
```


* The classes are all prefixed with `fg-` but you can change that in the scss and rebuild by changing the `$proj` variable in `assets/scss/styles.scss`.
